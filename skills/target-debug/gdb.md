# GDB — state autopsy, breakpoints and watchpoints

Part of the `target-debug` skill.

Start one server using the board's device/config and probe serial. These
OpenOCD examples cover STM32H7 with ST-Link and RP2040 with CMSIS-DAP;
select the installed OpenOCD `interface/` and `target/` configs for other boards:

```bash
JLinkGDBServer -device <JLINK_DEVICE> -select usb=<uid> -if SWD -speed 4000 -port 2331 -nogui -singlerun
openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32h7x.cfg -c 'adapter serial <uid>'
openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c 'adapter serial <uid>' -c 'adapter speed 5000'
```

## OpenOCD batch sessions

OpenOCD 0.12 does not emit `mdw` output from a `-c` script. Print a scripted
memory read explicitly; for example, the Cortex-M validity anchor is:

```bash
openocd ... -c 'init; echo [format 0x%08x [read_memory 0xE000EDF0 32 1]]; shutdown'
```

A failed command stops the rest of that `-c` script. Put a flash or
`verify_image` operation that may fail in its own session: a following
`reset run` or `shutdown` will not execute, and the target can be left halted.

RP2040 needs the roster's explicit `adapter speed` (5000 on the measured
CMSIS-DAP rigs); the 100 kHz default failed to connect the multidrop DAP.
Before `program`, run `init; reset halt`: without that state preparation the
flash algorithm failed to allocate its bounce buffer and left the core halted.

Connect with the matching toolchain's GDB (`arm-none-eabi-gdb <flashed.elf>`
for ARM), then `target remote :2331` for J-Link or `target remote :3333`
for OpenOCD. For an autopsy, use `monitor halt`; for a fresh start only,
use `monitor reset halt`, `load`, then `continue`.

Script JLinkGDBServer sessions with `-singlerun` — the server exits with the connection, and
back-to-back relaunches race the probe handle and hang. Symbols need the
firmware's DWARF: check the project's release configuration keeps it.

**Autopsy of a wedged board: attach and halt ONLY** — skip
`monitor reset halt` + `load` (those are for fresh starts; a reset destroys
the evidence). Symbolize with the ELF that is actually flashed — the one from the build
that wedged; do not rebuild while the wedge is still on the board. The
names to put in these slots are the project's (`projects/<name>.md` when the
skill keeps notes for it, else read the stack and the port driver first):

```gdb
p/x <device stack's endpoint state table>   # busy/stalled/claimed per endpoint
p <host stack's per-device state>           # addr, enum/config
p/x <port's private state>                  # per-port names — read the port driver first
x/32wx <USB peripheral base>                # raw EP/FIFO regs; base = the macro the driver uses
watch  <port's transfer bookkeeping field>  # HW watchpoint (Cortex-M: ~4)
break <the USB ISR>                         # works, but see warning below
```

**Hardware budget — read it off the chip** (verified: F407/M4 = 6 bp + 4 wp,
rp2040/M0+ = 4 + 2; M7 typically 8/4):

```gdb
p ((*(unsigned*)0xE0002000)>>4) & 0xF   # FPB NUM_CODE = hw breakpoints (M7 adds bits[14:12])
p (*(unsigned*)0xE0001000)>>28          # DWT_CTRL NUMCOMP = watchpoint comparators
```

- `hbreak`/`thbreak` force a hardware breakpoint (software breaks in flash
  need flash-breakpoint support — J-Link has it; OpenOCD: `bp <addr> 2 hw`);
  `tbreak` = one-shot.
- `watch -l <expr>` watches the address expr evaluates to once — almost
  always what you want; `rwatch`/`awatch` trap reads/any access (hardware-
  only — they error, never fall back). OpenOCD adds a data-VALUE match GDB
  can't express: `wp <addr> 4 w <value> [mask]` — catch who writes 0 into a
  busy flag, ignoring writes of 1.
- **Demand the word "Hardware" in the confirmation.** `watch` silently falls
  back to a software watchpoint when no DWT comparator fits — GDB then
  single-steps the whole program, hundreds of times slower: certain USB
  death. Plain `Watchpoint 2:` = delete it and narrow the expression
  (`watch -l`, cast to a 4-byte int).
- Conditional breaks (`break ... if ep_addr==0x81`) and `dprintf
  <loc>,"fmt",args` (printf without recompiling; keep `dprintf-style gdb`)
  are host-evaluated — no Cortex-M agent expressions in these stubs: every hit
  halts+resumes (~ms) even when the condition is false. Post-wedge/cold
  paths only; ISR-rate events belong in the RAM ring.
- `commands <bpnum> ... end` (start `silent`, end `continue`) auto-collects
  evidence per hit — same halt-per-hit cost.
- Stepping with the USB ISR firing between steps is chaos: OpenOCD
  `cortex_m maskisr steponly`. The bus runs either way — the host may still
  reset a halted-looking device.
- Poking state while halted (`set var <endpoint state>.busy = 0`)
  tests a hypothesis but invalidates the post-mortem — dump first, poke after.
- FreeRTOS examples: `-rtos GDBServer/RTOSPlugin_FreeRTOS` (OpenOCD: `-rtos
  FreeRTOS`) → `info threads` lists every task with state/prio/frame
  (verified: 6 tasks). It populates only after a
  run→stop cycle — plain attach shows one 0xDEAD placeholder. Semihosting is
  never the answer (traps + halts per call — RTT instead). **Monitor-mode
  debugging** (J-Link, M3+) keeps chosen IRQs serviced at a breakpoint —
  needs SEGGER's JLINK_MONITOR files + `SetMonModeDebug=1`; not set up here:
  <https://kb.segger.com/Monitor_Mode_Debugging> (untested).

While halted the device answers **nothing**: host control transfers time out
in ~5 s and the OS may reset/re-enumerate — after `continue`, the bus traffic
shows recovery, not the original bug. Prefer one halt for a post-mortem dump
over stepping through live USB traffic.
